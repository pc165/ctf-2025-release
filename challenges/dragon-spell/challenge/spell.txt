In the heart of a forgotten realm 
where time flowed like a river
and legends whispered through the wind,
there lies a forgotten spell,
a secret incantation to summon
the mightiest dragon.
This spell, passed down through
generations of dragon slayers
and dragon riders should
not be invoked in vain. 
If you still wish to seek out
the beast at your own peril.
Venture under the 
junction of stars.
But beware the quiver of fate,
the axis of destiny,
for they might have
other plans for you.
May your foolish zeal protect you.
I tell you now,
a truth, and it is this.
An ancient power stirs
beyond the veil.
Off the beaten path,
where shadows creep.
I sense a presence, 
silent but watchful.
Declare these words off
the top of your voice. 
Draconis, ignis, terra,
ventus, aqua.
Hear my plea, ancient soul,
From the depths of time,
arise and unfold.
Scales of emerald,
wings of night,
Answer the call,
with all your might.
