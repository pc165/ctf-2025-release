## How to solve
* This is a standard substitution cipher, where A-Z, .(period) and ,(comma) were replaced with the runes.
* Note: The runes are inspired by [Cirth runes](https://omniglot.com/conscripts/cirth.htm) but isn't the same 
* We intentially left `{` and `}` as is 
* So players will be able to find `C,T,F` right off the bat 
* Looking for `A, I, an, and, the, in` will help decipher the rest 
* The flag is `CTF{viridian}`, where `I, A, R` should be easier to guess.
