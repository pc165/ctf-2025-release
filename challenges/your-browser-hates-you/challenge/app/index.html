                <p><font color="black">It's been another day, and I've had zero visitors. I wonder if anyone even knows I exist. My scales are dull, my fire is weak, and my website is a ghost town. I've tried everything to attract some attentionâ€”posting about the latest dragon fashion trends, sharing recipes for dragon-sized meals, and even offering advice on how to properly hoard treasure. But nothing seems to work.</font></p>
                <p><font color="black">I've started to feel like I'm shouting into the void, with no one to hear my roar. The silence is deafening, and it's starting to get to me. I've begun questioning whether it's worth continuing to write if no one is going to read it.</font></p>

                <h5><font color="pink">Posted on a silent night, March 15, 2025</font></h5>
                <p><font color="black">The silence is agonizing. No comments, no likes, no shares. Just the sound of my own lonely roar echoing through the digital void. I've tried reaching out to other dragons, hoping they might understand my plight, but even they seem too busy with their own affairs to care.</font></p>
                <p><font color="black">I've started to wonder if I'm just not interesting enough. Maybe my writing is too dull, or my topics too mundane. But I thought that writing about being a dragon would be exciting! Who wouldn't want to read about fire-breathing, treasure hoarding, and flying through the skies?</font></p>

I spend my days hoarding treasure, flying through the skies, and writing about my adventures. But it seems like no one cares.</font></p>
                <p><font color="black">I'm starting to lose hope. Maybe I should just give up and focus on my treasure hoard instead. At least gold and jewels don't judge me.</font></p>
