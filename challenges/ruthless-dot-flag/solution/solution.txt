The r16 file format is a proprietary(?) format used by the "Tom
Clancy's ruthless.com" developed by Red Storm Entertainment and
released in 1998.

The format is pretty simple, with an 18 byte header, and then each
pixel is encoded into 16 bits (a short) as 5 bits of color for each
channel and 1 bit of alpha. The bit order is arrrrrgggggbbbbb but the
shorts are stored in little-endian so they actually go in as
gggbbbbbarrrrrgg.

The first flag is simply written in the image:

Flag1: CTF{oldie_but_goodie}

This can be seen many ways. Loading up the image as a 16 bit little
endian image in an image editor like GIMP will reveal the text well
enough despite the exact color details not being correct.

Another option is to grab a copy of the game
(https://www.myabandonware.com/game/tom-clancy-s-ruthless-com-diu) and
then to replace an existing game asset like Splash.r16 and the game
will display the image to you.

The provided r16_to_ppm.py converts the r16 format to a PPM (Netpbm
image) which can be converted to a PNG with pamtopng or imagemagick.


The second flag is encoded in the image's alpha channel. A field in
the header is set to no alpha so the game ignores the alpha bits.

Here is the header:

$ hexdump -vC ../distfiles/flags.r16 | head
00000000  03 20 02 58 00 00 01 00  01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |. .X............|
00000010  00 00 31 f3 31 73 31 77  31 77 31 f7 31 77 31 77  |..1.1s1w1w1.1w1w|

The first short 0x0320 is the image width in big-endian (800).
The second short 0x0258 is the height in big-endian (600).

The third short 0x0000 is no alpha (a value of 0x0200 appears to mean
use alpha). A value of 0x0100 also seems to work and also mean no alpha.

The fourth and fith shorts are 0x0100 (256) and their meaning is unknown (to me).

The remaining 8 bytes (4 shorts) are zero and may just be padding(?).


The second flag is simply encoded 1 bit per pixel into the alpha
bit. When all of the alpha bits are extracted the result is a PNG file
with the second flag. r16_extract_hidden_data.py does the extraction.

FLAG2: CTF{evilcorp_won}
