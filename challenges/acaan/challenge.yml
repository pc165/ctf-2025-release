  Welcome to the Memory Manipulation Service! Our revolutionary system allows you to edit any file in memory by providing three simple inputs: a target filename, an offset position, and your desired content. 
  
  The core binary is protected from disk modifications, but that's just the beginning of your journey. Your mission: discover how to weaponize this write-anywhere capability to capture the treasure.
  
  Can you outsmart the system's defenses?
